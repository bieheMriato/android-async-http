This article will explain what causes this issue and how to fix it using a simple solution.
 
## What Causes the Date Format Issue in Autodata 3.16?
 
The date format issue in Autodata 3.16 is caused by a mismatch between the time format setting in the data file and the chart properties. The data file is a .mdb file that contains the information that Autodata 3.16 uses to generate charts and reports. The chart properties are the settings that control how the chart looks and behaves.
 
By default, the time format setting in the data file is set to date/time, which means that the date is stored as a numerical value that represents the number of days since January 1, 1900. For example, January 1, 2021 is stored as 44202.
 
However, the chart properties may not recognize this format and may try to interpret the date as a string or a different numerical value. For example, if the chart properties expect a string format such as dd/mm/yyyy, then 44202 will be displayed as 0/0/0 or an error message.
 
## How to Fix the Date Format Issue in Autodata 3.16?
 
The easiest way to fix the date format issue in Autodata 3.16 is to change the time format setting in the data file from date/time to string. This will make the date compatible with any chart properties and avoid any confusion or errors.
 
To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Autodata 3.16 and go to File > Open Data File.
2. Select the data file that you want to fix and click Open.
3. Go to Tools > Schema Properties.
4. In the Schema Properties window, click on the Time Format drop-down menu and select String.
5. Click OK to save the changes and close the window.
6. Go to File > Save Data File As and save the data file with a new name or overwrite the original one.
7. Close Autodata 3.16 and reopen it.
8. Open the data file that you just fixed and create a chart as usual.
9. The date should now appear correctly in the chart and match your preferences.

The film was written and directed by Warwick Thornton, who is also an Aboriginal filmmaker. He based the film on his own experiences growing up in Alice Springs and working as a radio DJ. The film features mostly non-professional actors who speak in their native languages of Warlpiri and English.
  
The film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the CamÃ©ra d'Or at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival and six Australian Film Institute Awards. It was also selected as Australia's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 82nd Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.
  
The film follows the lives of Samson and Delilah, who are both 14 years old and live in a small Aboriginal community. Samson spends his days sniffing petrol and playing with his brother's band, while Delilah helps her grandmother paint traditional artworks. They have little interaction with each other until Samson decides to follow Delilah one day and steals her grandmother's car.
  
They drive to Alice Springs, where they face many hardships and dangers. They are rejected by their relatives, harassed by the police, and attacked by a group of homeless youths. They also struggle to find food, water, and shelter. They only have each other for support and comfort.
  
The film does not have a conventional plot or dialogue. It relies on the visual and auditory elements to convey the emotions and experiences of the characters. The film uses natural lighting, long shots, and ambient sounds to create a realistic and immersive atmosphere. The film also features original songs by Thornton and his brother Scott, who plays Samson's brother in the film.
  
The film has been praised for its authentic and powerful portrayal of the issues facing the Aboriginal people in Australia. The film also challenges the stereotypes and prejudices that often depict them as passive victims or violent criminals. The film shows the resilience and dignity of the characters, who are able to find moments of joy and beauty in their harsh circumstances.
  
The film also raises questions about the role and responsibility of the government, the media, and the society in addressing the problems of the Aboriginal communities. The film does not offer any easy solutions or judgments, but rather invites the viewers to empathize and reflect on the situation.
